                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        Pure Kanchipuram silk sarees are delicate and require special care.
                        We recommend dry cleaning as the primary method for cleaning these exquisite garments.
                        Professional dry cleaning ensures that the saree&apos;s colors and intricate weaving are preserved without any damage.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7 text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">2. Avoid Machine Washing:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        Never machine wash or use a washing machine to clean your Kanchipuram silk saree.
                        The mechanical action and harsh detergents used in washing machines can cause irreversible
                        damage to the delicate silk fibers and intricate zari work.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">3. Hand Wash with Care:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        If you choose to hand wash, use a mild detergent specifically formulated for silk or delicate fabrics. Gently wash the saree in cold water, avoiding excessive rubbing or wringing. Rinse thoroughly with cold water to remove any detergent residue.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">4. Do Not Soak:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        Avoid soaking the saree for an extended period. Prolonged exposure to water may affect the silk and the vibrant colors. Wash and rinse the saree promptly to minimize water contact.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">5. Dry Flat:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        After washing, lay the saree flat on a clean, dry towel to air dry. Avoid hanging the saree, as the weight of the wet fabric may cause stretching or distortion. Ensure the saree is dried away from direct sunlight to prevent color fading.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">6. Ironing Precautions:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        Iron your Kanchipuram silk saree on the reverse side using a low to medium heat setting. Place a cotton cloth over the saree before ironing to protect the delicate silk and intricate zari work. Avoid using a steam iron.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">7. Store Carefully:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        Store your saree in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. To prevent wrinkles, fold the saree with tissue paper to cushion the folds. Avoid using plastic covers, as they may trap moisture and lead to mildew.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">8. Beware of Perfumes and Deodorants:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        Avoid spraying perfumes or deodorants directly onto the saree, as some chemicals may affect the silk and zari. Apply these products before wearing the saree.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">9. Handle with Clean Hands:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        Ensure your hands are clean before handling the saree, especially if you apply lotions or creams. This helps prevent transferring oils and dirt onto the delicate fabric.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="pt-7  text-green-950 text-2xl px-3">10. Professional Restoration:</h3>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        If your Kanchipuram silk saree requires repair or restoration, consult with a professional silk specialist. Attempting to fix damages at home may lead to further issues.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pt-4 px-10 mx-5 about-width justify-center">
                        By following these care instructions, you&apos;ll contribute to preserving the beauty and integrity of your pure Kanchipuram silk sarees for generations to come.
